   **Sinister Senile** (Louisville)

   "One of many projects by experimental artist Kensaku Nishizato. Since 1986 the quest for new sounds and stretching the boundaries has led to the evolution of Sinister Senile in 1999. Kensaku was heavily evolved in the experimental scene in Asheville, NC for most of the 90's, and he has collaborated with Nurse With Wound, Val Denham, The Sword Volcano Complex, and many more."
