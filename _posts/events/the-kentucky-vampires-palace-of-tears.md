   Join us on Saturday, November 13th for another Dead Of Night & The Dark Market!



   This time we are very excited to share the night with New Orleans based Darkwave band The Palace Of Tears and Louisville's original Gothic Rock band The Kentucky Vampires.



   This event will also be streamed LIVE on our Twitch channel https://www.twitch.tv/radio_arcane_tv



   The Palace Of Tears:

   Erick r. Scheid and L.V. Darkling comprise the moody darkwave duo from New Orleans, blending elements of electro-shoegaze, ethereal witch house, and ritual ambient drone. Hypnotic electronics and swirling guitar lay fertile ground for sultry seductive vocals that soar and dreamy lyrics that captivate.



   The Kentucky Vampires:

   Founded in Louisville Kentucky. Though considered a deathrock band at its core, TKV has been known to mesh elements of post-punk, goth rock, and horror rock into an experience, some have considered beautiful, but scary.


   Along with the live music, there will be plenty of shopping available with the amazing artists of The Dark Market!



   There will also be FOOD available from The Limbo Food Truck!



   Live DJ action after the bands play so you can dance away the rest of the night to our world class Dark Music Specialists!



   This is essentially a short festival, so, come ready to indulge!
