   Radio Arcane presents:



   Harsh Symmetry (Los Angeles, California)

   Palm Ghosts (Nashville, Tennessee)

   Twice Dark (Bloomington, Indiana)

   Live at Art Sanctuary



   **Harsh Symmetry** is the synthesizer driven solo project of the California based musician Julian Sharwarko. Blending 80s post- punk and new wave influences with more contemporary genres like dark wave and minimal wave, Harsh Symmetry paints a refreshing and danceable picture while maintaining a good sense of revivalism.

   **Palm Ghosts** is the sound of an 80s prom in a war zone… located in the dead heart of country music, Nashville, TN. More at home in rainy Manchester, the quartet weaves cinematic dream pop and new wave with brooding post punk. Embracing their 80’s idols, like New Order, The Cure, David Bowie, John Carpenter and even Divine, Palm Ghosts take the genre to soaring new heights.

   **Twice Dark** is a goth, darkwave, coldwave, industrial, project created in 2020 by Josh Kreuzman between Indianapolis and Bloomington, IN.
