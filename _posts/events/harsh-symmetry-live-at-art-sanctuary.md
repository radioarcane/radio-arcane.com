   Radio Arcane presents:



   Harsh Symmetry (Los Angeles, California)

   Live performance at Art Sanctuary

   Opening support TBA.



   **Harsh Symmetry** is the synthesizer driven solo project of the California based musician Julian Sharwarko. Blending 80s post- punk and new wave influences with more contemporary genres like dark wave and minimal wave, Harsh Symmetry paints a refreshing and danceable picture while maintaining a good sense of revivalism.
