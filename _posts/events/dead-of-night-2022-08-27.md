   Radio Arcane Dark Music Specialists - Count Grozny & Sorrow Vomit!

   Vending by the talented Dark Market.

   **DJ Cinis** spins meticulously curated sets of synth and guitar-based dance melodies. First spinning in Boston for a decade (1995-2005) and later in Washington D.C. and Baltimore, in 2020 he transitioned to online livestreams like many other DJs. He is currently spinning tunes IRL during his 2022 Farewell Tour (Part I) which includes various U.S. cities. Tour dates go through the summer.



   Catch his weekly DJ set on Wax Radio on Friday mornings and his occasional Weekend Warm-Up livestream Twitch party. Find links to DJ Cinis’ various social media platforms at http://linktr.ee/djcinis.
