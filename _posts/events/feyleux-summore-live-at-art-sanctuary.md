   **Feyleux** is a new dark alternative group that formed in mid-2023, combining dreampop and darkwave. The duo's debut album, "Midnight Hearts," showcases edgy bass synth, swirling guitars, and icy 80s synthpop melodies while highlighting ethereal vocals. The songs delve into themes of love, loss, longing, and personal power through a darker lens, with lyrics touching on paranormal experiences, the occult, exploring liminal spaces, and even contact with the undead. "Midnight Hearts" strikes a balance between dreamy urgency and drama within the context of dark romanticism and a subtly danceable sense of anger

Together, they create a sound that is both enigmatic and mesmerizing, blending bright, catchy melodies with profound, often hidden, meanings. Their music invites listeners on a journey of discovery, where each listen reveals new layers and interpretations.
