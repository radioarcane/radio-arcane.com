   Radio Arcane presents:



   Spike Hellis (Los Angeles, California) live at Art Sanctuary with support by local EBM project Control I'm Here.




   **Spike Hellis** has already earned the respect of electronic music veterans in the LA scene, with tracks already remixed by Susan Subtract (High-Functioning Flesh, Physical Wash), Juan Mendez (Silent Servant), and have crossed to the other coast with mixes from NYC’s Multiple Man.

   **Control I’m Here** is the EBM project of Paul Chenault, member of the Hush Ltd art collective and remix contributor for artists Ex-Hyena, Pleasure Policy, Jackson VanHorn, Denial Waits, and Molotov Lust. Control I’m Here produces hard-hitting EBM infused with grooves and atypical genre conventions to bring a fresh perspective to the genre.
