   Afterhours : A Tribute To The Sisters Of Mercy -
   First and Last and Always was released in March, 1985 and we thought March, 2020 would be a good time to celebrate that history.


   It won’t be all Sisters but it will certainly be Sisters heavy. A night of tribute to one of the defining contributors of Gothic Rock (regardless of what Andrew Eldritch may say).
   Expect to hear Gothic Rock all night, both old and new, with heavy doses of genuine TSOM from the early EPs, the First and Last and Always era, Peel Sessions and who knows, maybe even some bootlegs.


   We’ll hit some related stuff as well, like the Sisterhood, Merciful Release stuff like The March Violets and early era The Mission.


   Probably some second wave Gothic bands like Rosetta Stone and Nosferatu etc. and some current bands that are keeping tradition alive like Sonsombre and The Kentucky Vampires.


   If Gothic Rock is your thing, this is your night!


   Feel free to post some requests in the comments!
