   **Palm Ghosts** is the sound of an 80s prom in a war zone…located in the dead heart of country music, Nashville, TN.

   More at home in rainy Manchester, the quartet weaves cinematic dream pop and new wave with brooding post punk.

   Embracing their 80’s idols, like New Order, The Cure, David Bowie, John Carpenter and even Divine, Palm Ghosts take the genre to soaring new heights.
