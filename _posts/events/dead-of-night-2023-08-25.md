   **5RVLN5** (Chicago, Illinois)

   5RVLN5 [Surveillance] is a post-industrial band, born from the sprawling urban decay of Chicagoâ€™s underground music scene. Ranging from nihilistic dissonance to straight up pounding disco-goth dance beats, 5RVLN5 is a sincere expression of all things haunting, cold, and grim.
