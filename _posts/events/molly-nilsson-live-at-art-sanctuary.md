   **Molly Nilsson** – Extreme

   "Ten albums in, the Sweden-born, Berlin-dwelling synth-pop singer is as lo-fi as ever, but her songwriting just gets stronger. Her sense of irony is potent and funny – hair-metal chords seem to skewer dumb aggression, and Earth Girls’s joyous chorus of “women have no place in this world” is a withering portrait of toxic masculinity – but Kids Today and Fearless Like a Child have a straightforward, moving naivety. Pompeii, meanwhile, is Calvin Harris-level pop that should have been huge. BBT" The Guardian

   **Palm Ghosts** is the sound of an 80s prom in a war zone…located in the dead heart of country music, Nashville, TN. More at home in rainy Manchester, the quartet weaves cinematic dream pop and new wave with brooding post punk.
   Embracing their 80’s idols, like New Order, The Cure, David Bowie, John Carpenter and even Divine, Palm Ghosts take the genre to soaring new heights.
