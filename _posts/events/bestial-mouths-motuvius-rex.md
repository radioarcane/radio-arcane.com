   Radio Arcane presents Bestial Mouths live at Art Sanctuary with local support Motuvius Rex.



   **Bestial Mouths**

   As the voice and spirit of Bestial Mouths, Lynette Cerezo is a majestic and haunting figure. Across international stages, her spellbinding performances take audiences through deeply emotional voidic visions. From their inception in 2009, the core root of Bestial Mouths has combined Cerezo’s voice with myriad genre influences across the spectrum of goth, industrial, post-punk, New Wave, noise, metal, and other underground sounds using live acoustic and electronic drums and analog synthesizers. With a history in fashion design and gender activism, Cerezo’s visual and social aesthetics are interwoven deeply into Bestial Mouth’s presentation, building outward into captivating theatrical live performances. Since 2018, Bestial Mouths has been the sole project of Cerezo, blossoming outward to incorporate new collaborators, new channels and aural pathways to explore deeply personal lyrics of self-stagnation and trauma. In their decade-plus existence, BESTIAL MOUTHS have worked with myriad acclaimed producers and artists. Zola Jesus, Mick Harvey, Rhys Fulber, Egyptrixx, Boy Harsher, Die Krupps, Mater Suspiria Vision, Zanias, The Horrorist, and Ludovico Technique are but a few collaborators, while they’ve shared the stage with the likes of Psychic TV, Austra, Chelsea Wolfe, DAF, 3 Teeth, OAKE, Front Line Assembly, White Ring, Suicide Commando, David J­­ , King Dude, Youth Code, Cut Hands and Light Asylum.

   **Motuvius Rex**

   Motuvius Rex is a Gothic Folk Rock band for the most part. A pinch of psychedelic atmosphere, a dash of Appalachian folk elements and mixed with a lot of influences from the New Romantics to hippie cult music experiments. All of this mixed with deep roots in Gothic Rock, New Wave and Neofolk music. Art School idiosyncrasies with a rural life experience that still keeps a firm hold within a Gothic framework. Basically, making Gothic Rock with a lot more acoustic instruments, which does include mandolins at times as well as some antiquated electronics. All mixed with a full live band. Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Motuvius Rex has performed and contributed bass for The Kentucky Vampires, as well as releasing music as Motuvius Rex. Currently signed with InClub Records in Lima, Peru. Motuvius Rex is also a founding member of the Dark Eclectic Music collective - Radio Arcane, also headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky.
