   Radio Arcane Presents - Black Rose Burning and Virgin Birth live at Art Sanctuary.



   **Black Rose Burning** is a very unique combination of Goth, Postpunk, Synthwave, Rock and Shoegaze.


   Reminiscent of bands like Tears For Fears and the Church, matched with the drive and determination of The Sisters Of Mercy and Bauhaus. Include the gothic-pop sensibilities of early Cult and The Cure.
