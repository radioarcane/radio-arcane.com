    "What is their music like? Their sound is like cool soil running through your fingers. It’s the zap on the tip of your tongue gently touched against a battery. It’s braving the bitter wilderness with a bow in hand, that shoots laser beams" - First Angel Media




    "The music featured on this gothic electropop duo’s latest release could soundtrack an immersive haunted house video game. “Hit the Bottom” alternates dramatically between loud and soft, the dynamic shifts tied together with emotive singing and menacing synth pulses." - Bored In Pittsburgh



    "Springing from sparse whispers into a rise of activity and back again ... vocals interacting with an unusual beat and shadowy, erupting guitar" - Skull Valley
    "Dramatic vocal performances and ominous gray pads ... covered in existential dread" - Divide and Conquer.
