   “Vancouver’s brilliant post-punk and new-wave quartet ACTORS continue their flair for sonic cinematics in the video for their latest track ‘Face Meets Glass’... The atmosphere quivers with singer Jason Corbett’s crooning reverb augmented by shivering guitars and stark synths.”

   Join us on Sunday, March 27th for an incredibly exciting night with ACTORS. We feel incredibly fortunate to host a band of this caliber and will call this a "do not miss" show. If you are familiar, you already know. If not, please take a minute to explore their website and enjoy a few of their excellent videos and music.

   **Broken Nails**

   To get things warmed up, we also have the great fortune of beloved Louisville local act Broken Nails from the excellent European label Swiss Dark Nights.



   "Inspired by Darkwave, Minimal Synth and EBM sounds. Primarily composed from analogue synthesizers and drum machines. Presenting strong, dance worthy percussion, a mixture of dark, cold and melancholy synth layers."

   **Palm Ghosts**

   And from Nashville, TN we have another shot of fun with Palm Ghosts - Palm Ghosts imagines dream pop, new wave and dark cinematic textures into an eclectic musical potpourri. "An 80s Prom In A War Zone"
