   Broken Nails:

   To get things warmed up, we also have the great fortune of beloved Louisville local act Broken Nails from the excellent European label Swiss Dark Nights.



   "Inspired by Darkwave, Minimal Synth and EBM sounds. Primarily composed from analogue synthesizers and drum machines. Presenting strong, dance worthy percussion, a mixture of dark, cold and melancholy synth layers."

   Shark Sandwich:

   And for a shot of energy and excitement we have another Louisville local band, the ever FUN and exciting Shark Sandwich!



   "We're from Louisville, we hate fuckboys, and write punk music."
