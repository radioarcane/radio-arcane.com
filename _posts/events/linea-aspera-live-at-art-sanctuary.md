   Please join us on Monday, April 4th for an incredibly exciting night with Linea Aspera. Once again we feel incredibly fortunate to host a band of this caliber and will call this another "do not miss" show.




   "Linea Aspera comprises of the synths & programming of Ryan Ambridge and the vocals of Alison Lewis aka Zanias. First drawn together in 2011 in London through a shared passion for coldwave, minimal synth and electronic body music and a collection of vintage analogue synthesizers, their emergence was swift, with songs written over the course of just a few hours at a time. Nine months of writing and recording in a student flat on Caledonian Road culminated in the release of their self-titled album in September, 2012 on Dark Entries Records. The albumâ€™s 8 tracks explore themes of loss, revenge and renewal through scientific analogies, driven by ice-cold melodies drenched in analogue warmth. After a short run of well received live shows in London and around Europe, the project was put on hiatus until this year."

   **Broken Nails**

   To get things warmed up, we also have the great fortune of beloved Louisville local act Broken Nails from the excellent European label Swiss Dark Nights.



   "Inspired by Darkwave, Minimal Synth and EBM sounds. Primarily composed from analogue synthesizers and drum machines. Presenting strong, dance worthy percussion, a mixture of dark, cold and melancholy synth layers."
