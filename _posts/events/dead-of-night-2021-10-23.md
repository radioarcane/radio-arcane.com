   Join us on Saturday, October 23rd as Dead Of Night ushers in Halloween with A Night Like This, Tribute To The Cure.



   That’s right, Robert Smith and company all night long as well as related bands like the Glove and Siouxsie and the Banshees and pretty much anything we can dig up that’s worthy of the Cure and their greatness!



   18+ $5 after 10pm or free for any early bats that get there beforehand.
