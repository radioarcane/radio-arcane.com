   Radio Arcane Presents: Dead Of Night & The Dark Market feat. The Electric Exorcism Tour




   The Nightmare continues on Friday, October 27th as Dead Of Night & The Dark Market keep up the monthly grind of dark eclectic music. Come out and help keep the dancefloor barely alive as we celebrate the glum drudgery of our dreadful existence.




   This month will feature:



   - Live performance by Curse Mackey, I Speak Machine and SINE

   - Radio Arcane Dark Music Specialists - TBA

   - Vending by the talented Dark Market.

   - Food Truck - TBA

   - Drinks by the enchanting Lany StarDust


   18+

   $10 Advanced tickets

   $15 Day of show



   Curse Mackey, I Speak Machine and SINE combine forces for a nightclub themed tour called The ELECTRIC EXORCISM!

   The ELECTRIC EXORCISM TOUR will launch on October 10th in Austin,Texas!

   It is as much a show as a travelling themed club night fueled on heavy-duty beats, dark synths, sin and surrealism.
