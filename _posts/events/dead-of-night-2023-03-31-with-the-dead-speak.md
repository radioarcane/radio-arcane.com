   The Nightmare continues on Friday, February 24th as Dead Of Night & The Dark Market keep up the monthly grind of dark eclectic music. Come out and help keep the dancefloor barely alive as we celebrate the glum drudgery of our dreadful existence.




   This month will feature:



   - Live performance by The Dead Speak (Louisville)

   - Radio Arcane Dark Music Specialists - TBA

   - Vending by the talented Dark Market.

   - Food Truck - TBA

   - Drinks by the enchanting Lany StarDust



   **The Dead Speak** is a Louisville, Kentucky-based horror cow-beret duo that invoke goth rockabilly energy. Jaime Muerte (she/her) and Wayne Robinson (he/him) fuse guttural, impassioned vocals with stories centering around themes of suicide, folklore and substance abuse.
