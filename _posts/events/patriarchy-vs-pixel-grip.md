   **Patriarchy** (Los Angeles)

   "Patriarchy has been called goth, industrial and, our favorite, "snuff metal." However you choose to describe the project, the fact remains: Patriarchy is Actually Huizenga. The musician, performance artist and provocateur is joined live by two male ex-models, whom Huizenga claims she met through two different junk removal and disposal services: "As soon as they tried my stiletto heels on, they were in," she says. "A Cinderella story with an extra 10 inches and a lot more chain."

   **Pixel Grip** (Chicago)

   "Pixel Grip celebrate the club as a sacred queer space.
   In the world of Chicago goth dance trio Pixel Grip, “the arena” is more than a literal venue where spectators gather to delight in competition—it refers to any context our society envisions as a zero-sum game, where no one can win without someone else losing. The band’s sophomore album, Arena, proposes the club as a sanctuary."
