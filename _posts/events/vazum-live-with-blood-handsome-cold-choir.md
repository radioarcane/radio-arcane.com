   **Cold Choir**

   Electro/Darkwave duo with poetic, evocative lyrics, sensual vocals dressed in a cloak of moody soul, with a ferocious power and a vulnerable delivery. Growing up in Miami in the 90s they were heavily influenced by the music they would encounter playing in the clubs of the time. From Electro and Freestyle to Darkwave and Techno their music has no rules or boundaries.
