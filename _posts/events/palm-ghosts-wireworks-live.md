   Radio Arcane presents - Palm Ghosts from Nashville, TN with support from Louisville's own Wireworks, live at Mag Bar! In addition, there will be a curated DJ set by Motuvius Rex as retro themed show Wave Runner Romantic.




   **PALM GHOSTS** (Nashville)

   The sound of an 80s prom in a war zone…located in the dead heart of country music, Nashville, TN. That is the sound and spirit of Palm Ghosts, as far from the honky-tonks and pedal taverns of their adopted city as one can get. More at home in rainy Manchester or blustery Berlin, the quartet weaves early cinematic dream pop and new wave with brooding post punk. Embracing their 80’s idols like New Order, The Cure, David Bowie and Peter Gabriel to name a few, these Nashville transplants released 2018’s Architecture. Since then, they have built upon that release with a steady stream of songs invigorating the modern era with the 80’s youth ethos.
