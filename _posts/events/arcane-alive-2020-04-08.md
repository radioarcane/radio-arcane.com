  Radio Arcane presents:



  **Secret Shame** - Ashville, NC : Darkwave, Post-punk, New Wave, Gothic

  "Secret Shame make gloomy, melodic rock steeped in '80s goth and post-punk." - BrooklynVegan

  https://secretshame.bandcamp.com



   **Reduction Plan** - Queens, NY : Darkwave, Goth, Industrial, Post-punk
   Reduction Plan's music comes from within solitude's frigid embrace. Pulling from 80s goth, industrial, dream-pop, as well as cacophonous no-wave, Reduction Plan uses both noise and space to illustrate the power of silence.
