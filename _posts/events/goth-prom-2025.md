   Radio Arcane Presents: The Louisville Goth Prom featuring Feyleux 




   It's prom season! Join us for this year's Goth Prom with special guest Feyleux.

   - Feyleux 

   - Radio Arcane Dark Music Specialists - DJ Count Grozny + Gothic Bastard + Motuvius Rex

   - Vending by the talented Dark Market.

   - Food Truck - TBA
