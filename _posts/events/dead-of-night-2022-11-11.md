   **Ships In The Night** (New York)

   "An electrifying mix of haunting, dark electronic and ethereal, ambient lullabies. Alethea Leventhal's magnetic solo project pulls from dreams, memories and echoes from the outer world to paint an atmospheric landscape with sweeping waves of synths and kinetic beats."

   https://shipsinthenight.bandcamp.com



   **Solemn Shapes** (Charlotte, NC)

   "North American electronic, dark synth band based in Charlotte, NC. Scott Sunset and Melanie Foxfire perform live with synthesizers, samplers and drum machines to create dark distorted beats, vocal/sample effects and warped synth tones which evoke a haunting, psychedelic vibeâ€¦Solemn Shapes lives somewhere between 80's horror soundtracks & a dark dance floor in the dead of night."

   "PRIMAL INDUSTRIAL BLUES. TO BE PLAYED AT MAXIMUM VOLUME."
