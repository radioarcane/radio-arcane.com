  Seventh episode of Radio Arcane with hosts Brian Drabant, Motuvius Rex and Gothic Bastard : Featuring interview and playlist from Dark Music Duo Thulsa Goon and Talamasca and host Steve Vessell of Warped Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky. Crackin' some beers and sodas and having a nice chat about music they like, how they started out and what's coming up in Louisville like Louisville is Dead festival, Louisville Krampus Celebration, Louisville Gore Club and more! : With quite a bit of awkward banter between the hosts to keep them from weeping and moaning their mortal gloom. Recorded and produced at the non-profit Art Sanctuary in Louisville, KY, Radio Arcane is a collective of Dark Music Specialists that host events, live music and dark arts entertainment.
