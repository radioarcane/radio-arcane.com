  Fifth episode of Radio Arcane with hosts Brian Drabant, Motuvius Rex, Gothic Bastard, Sorrow Vomit and Kaleidoscope with special guest input from 'Ultimate Christian Death Fan' Randy. Our first episode of 'BAD BLOOD': We explore and discuss the history, art and drama of Christian Death and the divide between Rozz and Valor. Specialty segment 'Deep Cuts' with Sorrow Vomit : And quite a bit of awkward banter between the hosts to keep them from weeping and moaning their mortal gloom. Recorded and produced at the non-profit Art Sanctuary in Louisville, KY, Radio Arcane is a collective of Dark Music Specialists that host events, live music and dark arts entertainment.
