  Inaugural episode of Radio Arcane with hosts Brian Drabant, Motuvius Rex and
  Gothic Bastard: featuring local and regional dark music from Louisville and
  surrounding area, specialty segment 'Deep Cuts' with Sorrow Vomit and quite a
  bit of awkward banter between the hosts to keep them from weeping and moaning
  their mortal gloom. Recorded and produced at the non-profit Art Sanctuary in
  Louisville, KY, Radio Arcane is a collective of Dark Music Specialists that
  host events, live music and dark arts entertainment.
