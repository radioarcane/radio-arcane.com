  Third episode from Radio Arcane with hosts Brian Drabant, Motuvius Rex, Gothic
  Bastard and Sorrow Vomit : Featuring interview with Albie Mason of Scary Black
  about his new album 'Shadow Dwellers (B​-​Sides)', his creative process and a
  couple of NEVER TO BE RELEASED EXCLUSIVE TRACKS! Plus one demo clip glimpse of
  the future!



  Brian Cole of Funeral Party Records also shows up for more because he hates
  himself but LOVES to PARTY! : Specialty segment 'Deep Cuts' with Sorrow Vomit
  : And quite a bit of awkward banter between the hosts to keep them from
  weeping and moaning their mortal gloom. Recorded and produced at the
  non-profit Art Sanctuary in Louisville, KY, Radio Arcane is a collective of
  Dark Music Specialists that host events, live music and dark arts
  entertainment.
