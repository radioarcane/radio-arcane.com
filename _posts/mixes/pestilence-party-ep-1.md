   The pandemic has changed a lot. In the before times, being together in a live space with music enabled so much release and expression for us. It continues to be a way for us to work through a lot in our lives, a way for us to process the societal noise and get away for a bit. To reset.



   In the wake of no live events and no festivals, I really came to realize the absence of this. And to be frank, have really been struggling. Maybe you are as well.



   So, I want to share something that’s been a year in the making. Think of them as digital DJ journal entries.



   One for every month last year, informed by the endless barrage of current events. Inspired by the emotions we have been feeling for a while now.



   Every Sunday evening for the next 12 weeks a new episode will be released!



   Until we can connect in the club or on the dance floor again, I hope these episodes resonate with you. Please like, share, and let me know your thoughts in the comments.
