   One of the best Halloweens/Samhains we have ever had!


   This is a small sample of the set I spun at our Warped Wednesday Halloween Party back in October 2018. The night was filled with dancing, requests, a raffle, the trick or treat libations wheel, classic holiday movies, food, and desserts! Not to mention some great costumes!


   Warped Wednesday is a monthly night of synthwave, coldwave, darkwave, post-punk, punk, ebm, industrial and classic alternative at Seidenfaden's in Louisville, KY. The last Wednesday of every month. Thulsa Goon and I founded WW with Steve Vessell (aka The Louisville Gore Club). Since we've temporarily relocated, right now DJs Kaleidoscope and Sorrow Vomit are taking this community event to new realms!
