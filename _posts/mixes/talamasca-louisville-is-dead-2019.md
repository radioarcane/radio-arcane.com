description: >-
   A super eclectic mix of metal, punk, goth rock, post-punk, and dark wave. If you ever wanted a peek inside my musical brain, the Deadfest afterparty is it.



   This is a small live sampling from the Louisville is Dead 2019 Day 2 Afterparty at MagBar in Louisville, KY. Louisville is Dead Fest, or simply Deadfest is an annual festival that is always about local music and local art. Always all ages. Proceeds from 2019 benefitted Girls Rock Louisville, an organization which fosters creative expression and self-esteem in girls, trans, and gender non-conforming youth.



   Louisville is Dead is produced by Riotheart Media!
