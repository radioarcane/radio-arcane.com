In the before times, being together in a live space with music enabled so much release and expression for us. It continues to be a way for us to work through a lot in our lives, a way for us to process the societal noise and get away for a bit. To reset.</p><p>In the wake of no live events and no festivals, I really came to realize the absence of this. And to be frank, have really been struggling. Maybe you are as well.</p><p>So, I want to share something that’s been a year in the making. Think of them as digital DJ journal entries.</p><p>One for every month last year, informed by the endless barrage of current events. Inspired by the emotions we have been feeling for a while now.</p><p>Every Sunday evening for the next 12 weeks a new episode will be released!</p><p>Until we can connect in the club or on the dance floor again, I hope these episodes resonate with you. Please like, share, and let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p><ul><li>Fuckfray (Talamasca Mix) — Zamilska</li><li>Star Eater — Daniel Deluxe</li><li>The Fall — Gary Numan</li><li>Ne Teselli Ne Avuntu (The Soft Moon Remix) — Jakuzi</li><li>Worlock — Skinny Puppy</li><li>Essenbeck — Die Krupps</li><li>R.O.V.
