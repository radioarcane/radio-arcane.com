Since their inception, the group has demonstrated a strong commitment to dark, gothic modes of musical expression. While homage is certainly (and devoutly) paid to their 1980s predecessors, a distinctly modern approach to personal and political struggle places NOX NOVACULA in a category of their own.”<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://noxnovacula.bandcamp.com\">https://noxnovacula.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><strong>STREET FEVER</strong><br>“Idaho-raised artist, Street Fever, paints a picture of sonically versatile and decimating performance art. They blend aspects of techno, industrial, electro, rap, hardcore and EBM to bring you a gritty symphony of seductive, captivating sound, full of light and transcendent energy. After losing all their possessions, being institutionalized multiple times and nearly losing their life in a South East Asian prison, this project has since been reborn and aims to use it as a platform to speak on their own recovery and addiction. Now more than ever they are empowered to share their story in hopes to connect with others who are seeking personal and spiritual growth.”<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://streetfever.bandcamp.com\">https://streetfever.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><strong>ALBIE DAMNED</strong><br>Albie Mason of Scary Black has a new project called Albie Damned.
