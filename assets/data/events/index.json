Across international stages, her spellbinding performances take audiences through deeply emotional voidic visions. From their inception in 2009, the core root of Bestial Mouths has combined Cerezo’s voice with myriad genre influences across the spectrum of goth, industrial, post-punk, New Wave, noise, metal, and other underground sounds using live acoustic and electronic drums and analog synthesizers.

A pinch of psychedelic atmosphere, a dash of Appalachian folk elements and mixed with a lot of influences from the New Romantics to hippie cult music experiments. All of this mixed with deep roots in Gothic Rock, New Wave and Neofolk music. Art School idiosyncrasies with a rural life experience that still keeps a firm hold within a Gothic framework. Basically, making Gothic Rock with a lot more acoustic instruments, which does include mandolins at times as well as some antiquated electronics. All mixed with a full live band. Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Motuvius Rex has performed and contributed bass for The Kentucky Vampires, as well as releasing music as Motuvius Rex. Currently signed with InClub Records in Lima, Peru.

After losing all their possessions, being institutionalized multiple times and nearly losing their life in a South East Asian prison, this project has since been reborn and aims to use it as a platform to speak on their own recovery and addiction.

To do this, each frame was hand inked, which creates a gorgeously surreal feel to the movie that is unique and beautiful.<br>A must see for any film history lovers.</p><p>About the band:</p><p><strong>Water Is The Sun</strong> - US 2024<br>There are moments of silent depth in which the winter of the scalpel of meaning and the spring of the sound-born, unleashed body look upon the world fully present. when the notes at last are heard, the ordered world is their indistinguishable score. the ritual of process is that which carries. the process of ritual is that which brings moments both transitory and immortal, apprehended by musician, seer, clairvoyant, herald; the welling tones that emanate from the crystal salt of shattered primordial sea; the melody that creeps unheard from unseen distance across the desert blaze and the knowledge of man; the hymns that blare in whispers from mountain peak and valley depth, beams of their power streaming into the ordered world, in confluence with body, voice and soul, dissolving it again and again.<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://wateristhesun.bandcamp.com\">https://wateristhesun.bandcamp.com</a></p><p>18+ Entry<br>21+ Bar<br>$8 advanced<br>$12 day of show</p>","shortDescription":"","facebookEventLink":"https://www.facebook.com/events/s/evening-tea-rapsodia-satanica-/938283311215899","ticketsLink":"https://art-sanctuary.ticketleap.com/evening-tea","cover":"8.00","expired":true,"youtube":"","location":{"title":"Art Sanctuary","address":"1433 S Shelby St.","address2":"","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","zipcode":"40217","venueLink":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Arts---Entertainment/Art-Sanctuary-122260903695","googleMapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Art+Sanctuary/@38.2264103,-85.7413458,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe8b5fa85d9ebd15f?ved=2ahUKEwjD0efWu_rfAhVKhq0KHV-nAdMQ_BIwDnoECAEQCA"}}},{"node":{"id":"994bdf48","path":"/events/dead-of-night-2024-03-29/","slug":"dead-of-night-2024-03-29","title":"2024-03-29 Radio Arcane","displayName":"Dead Of Night & The Dark Market - Ostara","eventType":"radio-arcane","cancelled":false,"date":"2024-03-29","startDatetime":"2024-03-29 21:00:00","endDatetime":"2024-03-30 02:00:00","image":"/img/uploads/dead-of-night-2024-03-29.jpg","webp":"/img/webp/dead-of-night-2024-03-29.webp","pageImage":"","pageImageWebp":null,"description":"<p>Radio Arcane Presents: Dead Of Night &amp; The Dark Market - Ostara</p><p>The Nightmare continues on Friday, March 29th as Dead Of Night &amp; The Dark Market keep up the monthly grind of dark eclectic music.

Anderson has also recorded and toured as a member of such as projects as Jessica Bailiff, Dylan Ettinger, In Gowan Ring, Lovesliescrushing, Annelies Monseré, Stone Breath, and Turn Pale.</p><p>Drekka owes something to the soundscapes and non-linear impressionism of Cindytalk or COIL, the industrial gravity of Einstürzende Neubauten or Hafler Trio, and the cinematic collaborations of Edward Artemiev/Andrei Tarkovsky or Simon Fisher Turner/Derek Jarman. But his work is singular, unique, and very personal.</p><p>Throughout years of performing and recording, Drekka has explored early industrial tape culture, fragile bedroom noise-folk, and expansive cinematic textures. His work and performances touch on themes of silence, memory, and forgetfulness. But rather than obscure himself, as is so often the effect of experimental music, DREKKA functions as a direct line into Anderson's mind and his tenuous cache of memories. These personal aspects and this fragility are clearly on display, rather than being obfuscated by poetic abstractions.</p><p>While &quot;haunting&quot; and &quot;hypnogogic&quot; are words often used to describe experimental music and art, DREKKA unequivocally occupies and deals in those dark spaces which comprise the tenuous province of memory and dreams. Those are the real ghosts of time and sound.</p><p>Just as prominent, particularly in the live setting, is a sort of confrontation; a wrestling with frenetic energy that approaches mania or ecstasy. Just as DREKKA's recordings serve not to obscure but to exhibit Michael Anderson's mind, his performances serve to exhibit his person, his body. DREKKA's audiences behold not an anonymous face in the glow of a laptop, but a man riding his flimsy card table strewn with tape players, bells, trinkets, metal, and pedals. They behold a man's spirit riding him, contact microphone in mouth, hands shifting cassettes collected over time and distance. DREKKA's audiences behold a confrontation of spirit, body, memory, and sound.<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://drekka.bandcamp.com\">https://drekka.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><strong>post doom romance</strong><br>DADA-esque assemblages of sound and image passed back and forth like love letters between seah and mykel boyd.<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://postdoomromance.bandcamp.com\">https://postdoomromance.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><strong>Sinister Senile</strong><br>Sinister Senile is an evolving experimental project with a dark yet pretty electro-accoustc edge.<br>The project was founded in 1997 by artist Kensaku Nishizato.

He has been a staple in the American Gothic Scene for decades from coast to coast. Currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area, his unique way of bringing joy to a dancefloor can be experienced regularly at multiple clubs, including Night Shift, 1984, and The Box, just to name a few, and can also be enjoyed on the weekly Hanging Garden Radio Show, which is heard throughout Northern California or anywhere in the world through the internet.</p><p>A love of, and devotion to, music has manifested in many forms over Owen's lifetime. Aside form being a trained classical musician in his own right, Owen has spun professionally in such divergent musical genres as Swing, 80's, Indie, Current Top 40, and Lounge. Even in the Goth/Industrial realm, he is unusually diverse, spinning anything from Ethereal, to Aggrotech &amp; EBM, to Deathrock, to 80's &amp; 90's Industrial, and much more. He simply has a passion for music, itself, and sharing the feeling of experiencing its transcendence with others. This is why he is so eager to take and play as many requests as possible from the crowd. A club is a place to feel good.</p><p>The Gothic Scene is something truly special. It is more than a place to go out; it is a genuine community. This is what draws many people it be part of it and this is why many of those people continue to be with it well after their peers in age have lost interest in going to clubs. When not behind the DJ tables, you will often find Owen loving this community. Chances are good he is probably dancing on the floor or conversing with everyone. His personal contributions include creating clubs and festivals, playing benefits whenever possible, and even constructing group trips and tours.</p><p>When you see Owen around, say hello, make musical requests, and most of all, have a great time. After all, we're among friends and the joy of music.

Interpolating darkly shimmering layers of angular guitar and pulsating darkwave, WINGTIPS sharpen their anthemic rush with an increasing penchant for melody and an atmosphere equally informed by post-punk as sweeping electronica. &quot;EXPOSURE THERAPY&quot; is a contextualization of new romantic for post-millennial end times, and a refreshing mix of synthpop and darkwave with hooks so compelling they are cinematic in scope.</p><p>In late 2020, the duo teased a stylistic shift towards a more bombastic pop sound with their cover of the Savage Garden single “TEARS OF PEARLS”. The track garnered excited press acclaim, and was lauded by none other than Darren Hayes himself.

Debut full- length Veins came next in 2016 and was backed by extensive touring. 2017’s Fragments found the band expanding to a bigger, more atmospheric and synth- heavy sound. The album landed on many year-end lists and helped earn slots on festivals such as Cold Waves, Terminus, Absolution, Wave Gotik Treffen, and murder of crows. Thin skies, bootblacks’ first album for Artoffact Records, zooms forward where fragments left off. The nine songs combine a driving, dancefloor pulse with soulful, melodic post-punk, yielding results that are positively anthemic. Produced by Jason Corbett of Artoffact labelmates Actors, Thin Skies evokes scenes of dark days and reckless nights in the urban jungle – a marriage of post-punk emotion and clubland sweat. Frontman Panther Almqvist’s brooding voice captivates as it veers from detached cool to deep vulnerability. Guitarist Alli Gorman’s hard jangle channels the trademark delay techniques of [U2’s] the Edge, and in the words of <a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://Post-Punk.com\">Post-Punk.com</a>.
