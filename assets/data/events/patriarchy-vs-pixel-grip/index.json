The musician, performance artist and provocateur is joined live by two male ex-models, whom Huizenga claims she met through two different junk removal and disposal services: &quot;As soon as they tried my stiletto heels on, they were in,&quot; she says. &quot;A Cinderella story with an extra 10 inches and a lot more chain.&quot; (Revolver Magazine)<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.actuallyactually.com\">https://www.actuallyactually.com</a><br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://patriarchy.bandcamp.com/music\">https://patriarchy.bandcamp.com/music</a></p><p><strong>Pixel Grip</strong> (Chicago)<br>&quot;Pixel Grip celebrate the club as a sacred queer space. In the world of Chicago goth dance trio Pixel Grip, “the arena” is more than a literal venue where spectators gather to delight in competition—it refers to any context our society envisions as a zero-sum game, where no one can win without someone else losing. The band’s sophomore album, Arena, proposes the club as a sanctuary.&quot;<br>by Micco Caporale<br>May 12, 2021<br>Chicago Reader<br><a target=\"_blank\"
