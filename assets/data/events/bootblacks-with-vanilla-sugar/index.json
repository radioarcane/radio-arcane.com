Debut full- length Veins came next in 2016 and was backed by extensive touring. 2017’s Fragments found the band expanding to a bigger, more atmospheric and synth- heavy sound. The album landed on many year-end lists and helped earn slots on festivals such as Cold Waves, Terminus, Absolution, Wave Gotik Treffen, and murder of crows. Thin skies, bootblacks’ first album for Artoffact Records, zooms forward where fragments left off. The nine songs combine a driving, dancefloor pulse with soulful, melodic post-punk, yielding results that are positively anthemic. Produced by Jason Corbett of Artoffact labelmates Actors, Thin Skies evokes scenes of dark days and reckless nights in the urban jungle – a marriage of post-punk emotion and clubland sweat. Frontman Panther Almqvist’s brooding voice captivates as it veers from detached cool to deep vulnerability.

Keyboardist Barrett Hiatt’s arpeggiated synths are the life force pushing the songs relentlessly forward, as Larry Gorman bashes a mix of acoustic and electronic drums with power and perfection. Backing vocals come courtesy of Shannon Hemmett (Actors) and Kennedy Ashlyn (SRSQ, Them Are Us Too).&quot;</p><p><strong>Scary Black:</strong><br>&quot;Since we featured the wicked “Root of Self Hate” last Spring, the quality of the releases by Louisville, Kentucky based one-man-band  Scary Black seem to know no setbacks.</p><p>It’s the case also for the brand new single “Starlightdancer”, where to his signature haunting and shadowy, gothic-horror-infused darkwave/post-punk sound, he adds a subtle and alluring danceable ‘disco’ twist.</p><p>It’s the case also for the brand new single “Starlightdancer”, where to his signature haunting and shadowy, gothic-horror-infused darkwave/post-punk sound, he adds a subtle and alluring danceable ‘disco’ twist.</p><p>Unremitting hypnotic throbbing bass loop along with repetitive frosty snare thwacks are pierced by chilling, searing guitar leads that bleeding and chiming atop injecting a profound feeling of pain and alienation as deep, slightly hoarse, charismatic vocals, consumed by anger and regret, watch a woman doomed to dance, ever so beautifully, under the stars. “Starlightdancer” he sings in an achingly emotional echoed chorus laced with helplessness longing and sadness, intensified by dramatic gauzy swathes of synths, whilst seamlessly writhe and twist, in a slow yet ruthless pace, towards the darkness.&quot;<br>White Light/White Heat</p><p>Radio Arcane DJs before, between, after.</p><p>18+ entry<br>21+ bar<br>$8 cover</p>","shortDescription":"Bootblacks live at Art Sanctuary with Scary Black & Wiirmz","facebookEventLink":"https://www.facebook.com/events/237986061159636","ticketsLink":"https://embed.showclix.com/event/bootblacks-with-vanilla-sugar","youtube":"","cover":"8.00","expired":true,"location":{"title":"Art Sanctuary","address":"1433 S Shelby St.","address2":"","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","zipcode":"40217","venueLink":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Arts---Entertainment/Art-Sanctuary-122260903695","googleMapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Art+Sanctuary/@38.2264103,-85.7413458,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe8b5fa85d9ebd15f?ved=2ahUKEwjD0efWu_rfAhVKhq0KHV-nAdMQ_BIwDnoECAEQCA"},"playlist":null}},"context":{}}
