Once again we feel incredibly fortunate to host a band of this caliber and will call this another &quot;do not miss&quot; show.</p><p>&quot;Linea Aspera comprises of the synths &amp; programming of Ryan Ambridge and the vocals of Alison Lewis aka Zanias. First drawn together in 2011 in London through a shared passion for coldwave, minimal synth and electronic body music and a collection of vintage analogue synthesizers, their emergence was swift, with songs written over the course of just a few hours at a time. Nine months of writing and recording in a student flat on Caledonian Road culminated in the release of their self-titled album in September, 2012 on Dark Entries Records. The albumâ€™s 8 tracks explore themes of loss, revenge and renewal through scientific analogies, driven by ice-cold melodies drenched in analogue warmth. After a short run of well received live shows in London and around Europe, the project was put on hiatus until this year.&quot;<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://lineaaspera.bandcamp.com/\">https://lineaaspera.bandcamp.com/</a></p><p><strong>Broken Nails</strong><br>To get things warmed up, we also have the great fortune of beloved Louisville local act Broken Nails from the excellent European label Swiss Dark Nights.</p><p>&quot;Inspired by Darkwave, Minimal Synth and EBM sounds. Primarily composed from analogue synthesizers and drum machines. Presenting strong, dance worthy percussion, a mixture of dark, cold and melancholy synth layers.&quot;<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.facebook.com/brokennailsmusic\">https://www.facebook.com/brokennailsmusic</a></p><p>18+ entry<br>21+ bar<br>$10 cover</p>","shortDescription":"Linea Aspera with Broken Nails","facebookEventLink":"https://www.facebook.com/events/2932170573700971","ticketsLink":"","youtube":"","cover":"10.00","expired":true,"location":{"title":"Art Sanctuary","address":"1433 S Shelby St.","address2":"","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","zipcode":"40217","venueLink":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Arts---Entertainment/Art-Sanctuary-122260903695","googleMapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Art+Sanctuary/@38.2264103,-85.7413458,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe8b5fa85d9ebd15f?ved=2ahUKEwjD0efWu_rfAhVKhq0KHV-nAdMQ_BIwDnoECAEQCA"},"playlist":null}},"context":{}}
