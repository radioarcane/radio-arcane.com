Scheid and L.V. Darkling comprise the moody darkwave duo from New Orleans, blending elements of electro-shoegaze, ethereal witch house, neoclassical and ritual ambient drone.

Scott Sunset and Melanie Foxfire perform live with synthesizers, samplers and drum machines to create dark distorted beats, vocal/sample effects and warped synth tones which evoke a haunting, psychedelic vibe... Solemn Shapes lives somewhere between 80's horror soundtracks &amp; a dark dance floor in the dead of night.</p><p><strong>Ships In The Night</strong> (Coney Island, NY)<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://shipsinthenight.bandcamp.com\">https://shipsinthenight.bandcamp.com</a></p><p>Ships In The Night is an electrifying mix of haunting, dark electronic and ethereal, ambient lullabies.
