That is the sound and spirit of Palm Ghosts, as far from the honky-tonks and pedal taverns of their adopted city as one can get. More at home in rainy Manchester or blustery Berlin, the quartet weaves early cinematic dream pop and new wave with brooding post punk. Embracing their 80’s idols like New Order, The Cure, David Bowie and Peter Gabriel to name a few, these Nashville transplants released 2018’s Architecture. Since then, they have built upon that release with a steady stream of songs invigorating the modern era with the 80’s youth ethos.<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://www.palmghosts.net\">http://www.palmghosts.net</a><br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://palmghosts.bandcamp.com\">https://palmghosts.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><strong>Wireworks</strong> (Louisville)<br>Alternative, Alternative Rock, Goth, Pop.<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://wireworks.bandcamp.com\">https://wireworks.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><strong>Wave Runner Romantic</strong> (Louisville)<br>80’s New Wave, Synthpop &amp; New Romantic Music curated by Motuvius Rex.<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/WaveRunnerRomantic\">https://www.mixcloud.com/WaveRunnerRomantic</a></p><p>21+ bar<br>$10 cover</p>","shortDescription":"Palm Ghosts • Wireworks • WaveRunnerRomantic","facebookEventLink":"https://www.facebook.com/events/401763548734190","ticketsLink":"","youtube":"","cover":"10.00","expired":true,"location":{"title":"Mag Bar","address":"1398 S 2nd St.","address2":"","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","zipcode":"40208","venueLink":"https://magbarlouisville.com","googleMapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Magnolia+Bar/@38.228843,-85.758187,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9b00e0844db75942!8m2!3d38.2288438!4d-85.7581869"},"playlist":null}},"context":{}}
