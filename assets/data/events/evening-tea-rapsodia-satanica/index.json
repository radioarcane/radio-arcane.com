To do this, each frame was hand inked, which creates a gorgeously surreal feel to the movie that is unique and beautiful.<br>A must see for any film history lovers.</p><p>About the band:</p><p><strong>Water Is The Sun</strong> - US 2024<br>There are moments of silent depth in which the winter of the scalpel of meaning and the spring of the sound-born, unleashed body look upon the world fully present. when the notes at last are heard, the ordered world is their indistinguishable score. the ritual of process is that which carries. the process of ritual is that which brings moments both transitory and immortal, apprehended by musician, seer, clairvoyant, herald; the welling tones that emanate from the crystal salt of shattered primordial sea; the melody that creeps unheard from unseen distance across the desert blaze and the knowledge of man; the hymns that blare in whispers from mountain peak and valley depth, beams of their power streaming into the ordered world, in confluence with body, voice and soul, dissolving it again and again.<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://wateristhesun.bandcamp.com\">https://wateristhesun.bandcamp.com</a></p><p>18+ Entry<br>21+ Bar<br>$8 advanced<br>$12 day of show</p>","shortDescription":"","facebookEventLink":"https://www.facebook.com/events/s/evening-tea-rapsodia-satanica-/938283311215899","ticketsLink":"https://art-sanctuary.ticketleap.com/evening-tea","youtube":"","cover":"8.00","expired":true,"location":{"title":"Art Sanctuary","address":"1433 S Shelby St.","address2":"","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","zipcode":"40217","venueLink":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Arts---Entertainment/Art-Sanctuary-122260903695","googleMapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Art+Sanctuary/@38.2264103,-85.7413458,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe8b5fa85d9ebd15f?ved=2ahUKEwjD0efWu_rfAhVKhq0KHV-nAdMQ_BIwDnoECAEQCA"},"playlist":null}},"context":{}}
