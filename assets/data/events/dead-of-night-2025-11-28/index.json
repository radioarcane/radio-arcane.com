Does it sound good? YOU DECIDE”<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://bbmcnoevil.bandcamp.com/album/basement-tapes-1\">https://bbmcnoevil.bandcamp.com/album/basement-tapes-1</a></p><p><strong>Decide Today</strong><br>Decide Today has been the primary project of Robert Inhuman, along with collaborators, following the end of the original Realicide band at the turn of 2011. Sonically it has spanned genres such as industrial, breakcore, darkwave and ambient, while its subject matter maintains focus akin to anarcho-punk and radical hiphop. The project's mission is a contribution to various liberation movements, whether decades ongoing or emerging from the current political climate. Decide Today is based in Cincinnati, has toured Turtle Island (North &quot;America&quot;) extensively, as well as many ventures across Europe, South America, and Australia.”<br><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://decidetoday.bandcamp.com\">https://decidetoday.bandcamp.com</a></p>","shortDescription":"","facebookEventLink":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1143804574536390","ticketsLink":"https://www.ticketleap.events/tickets/art-sanctuary/dead-of-night-black-friday","youtube":"","cover":"8.00","expired":true,"location":{"title":"Art Sanctuary","address":"1433 S Shelby St.","address2":"","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","zipcode":"40217","venueLink":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Arts---Entertainment/Art-Sanctuary-122260903695","googleMapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Art+Sanctuary/@38.2264103,-85.7413458,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe8b5fa85d9ebd15f?ved=2ahUKEwjD0efWu_rfAhVKhq0KHV-nAdMQ_BIwDnoECAEQCA"},"playlist":null}},"context":{}}
